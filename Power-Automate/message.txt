In an effort to improve compensation in our industry, I have been crowdsourcing salary data from sales employees in our field. The attached spreadsheet has up to date info for some of the leading businesses as well as breakouts by seniority and tenure. I saw you worked at Bob Jones Big Bank and was hoping you might be willing to share some data to add to the data set. 

Some people have had issues viewing the spreadsheet within browsers; your best bet is to download it and open it that way.

Hope this is of interest to you!

Best,

Phish Her
